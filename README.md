# DataVisulization-in-Excel
For my "Introduction to Computing Technology" class project, I undertook a teaching case analysis that significantly deepened my understanding of data science fundamentals. Through this project, I gained proficiency in Excel, specifically in data manipulation, visualization techniques, and generating insightful graphs and charts.

Furthermore, I learned how to extract relevant data from websites, a crucial skill for data scientists. By downloading and importing this data into Excel, I was able to transform raw information into visually compelling representations. This allowed me to distill complex datasets into easily digestible formats, making patterns and trends more apparent.

This project served as a pivotal learning experience, equipping me with essential data science skills that I will undoubtedly leverage in my future career. It reinforced the importance of data visualization in effectively communicating insights derived from large volumes of information.
